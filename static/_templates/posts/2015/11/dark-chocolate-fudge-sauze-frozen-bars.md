**Ingredients**

 - 4 parts cocoa powder
 - 2 parts coconut sugar (or other powdered sweetener)
 - 1 part butter (coconut oil will work too, but butter’s creaminess is better)
 - just under 1 part honey (the “syrupiness ” improves the consistency)
 - 1/2 parts water

**Instructions**

 - Put cocoa powder, sugar, honey, and about half the butter in a pan or pot
 - Heat on medium and stir continuously until mixture starts to darken (the butter is melting)
 - Add water and rest of butter
 - Stir continuously until butter is thoroughly melted

At this point you have a very rich, very thick fudge sauce.  You can use as is, or spread on parchment paper and freeze for several hours.

*__Tip__*: heating the entire mixture (as opposed to heating just the butter) helps ensure the result is smooth and without lumps.

*__Please note__*: it’s important the ratios be pretty exact.  I’m still standardizing them, so this recipe is subject to improvement.
