After changing our diet, one of the things Chloe and I sorely missed were the occasional baked goodies.  We found and enjoyed grain-free recipes for brownies, cake, and other things.  However, eventually, we experienced a longing for good old chocolate chip cookies!

[This recipe](http://detoxinista.com/2013/08/coconut-flour-chocolate-chip-cookies-grain-free/), courtesy of [detoxinista.com](http://detoxinista.com), turned out nicely and become our go-to.  Then, one adventurous night, I fiddled with the ingredients.  I replaced the sweetener with a blend of honey, coconut sugar, and maple syrup, tossed in a shot of whiskey, and baked with butter.  Chloe declared the first batch of buttery, whisky-laced, chocolate chip cookies a success!  (And no batch has been as good since… :( )

__Ingredients__

 - 1/3 cup coconut flour
 - 1/4 cup coconut oil or butter, melted
 - sweetener
     - 1 tablespoon of honey
     - several tablespoons of coconut sugar
     - a little bit of maple syrup
 - 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 - 1/4 teaspoon salt
 - 2 whole eggs (or 1 Tbsp of gelatin mixed with 1 Tbsp of cool water then 2 Tbsp of cool water)
 - approx. 1 ounce of chocolate (chocolate chips, chopped chocolate bar, etc.)

__Instructions__

 - Preheat oven to 350°F
 - Mix together all ingredients
 - Place the cookies on the baking tray
 - Place a small square of butter on top of each cookie
 - Bake for 10 minutes, flip cookies, bake another 2-10 minutes–or until golden brown+

__Tips for Success__

 - Flatten the cookies on the tray–they won’t flatten while baking.
 - Use a smooth whisky, like Jameson’s blended Irish whiskey.  This is so smooth there’s hardly any of the regular whiskey “bite.”

__A Note on the Sweetener__

Honey and coconut sugar are both used to balance each other out, as they both tend to have distinct flavors.  The maple syrup is intended to add a little maple flavor to complement the whisky.  If you are lacking any of these sweeteners, it shouldn’t significantly impact anything.  Also note that you may want to add more sweetener than this recipe calls for–we prefer things to not be very sweet.

I haven’t tried it, but I imagine rum would work nicely instead of whiskey.

+Exactly what sweeteners you use, and how much, can substantially impact the cooking time.
