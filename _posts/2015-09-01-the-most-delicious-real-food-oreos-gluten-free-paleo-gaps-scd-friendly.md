I absolutely LOVE oreos. In the distant past of a previous life, Will would oftentimes bring me home a little surprise gift of flowers and my own personal six pack of oreos. Delish! My favorite kinds are birthday cake and any with colored cream in the middle-somehow they seem to<!--more--> have just the right amount of fluffiness that you don’t get with double-stuffed or regular ol’ white cream.

When we started shifting over to a real food diet (all in the span of about 1 week), the oreos obviously had to go. It wasn’t easy, but come on, those cookies don’t even have any kind of real dairy in them. Or eggs. Or anything you SHOULD find in a creamy, chocolate-y, crunchy cookie. We lived without them in our lives for about 6 months, at which time, I decided I was gonna have them in my life one way or another. At least, I was determined to find a way to make a healthy version. This is what we came up with: a softer, creamier, melt-in-your-mouth, all around better oreo.

***<u>Cookies</u>***<br />
1/3 cup cconut flour<br />
3 Tbsp. cocoa powder<br />
1/8 cup coconut oil<br />
1/8-1/4 cup melted butter<br />
1/4 cup sweetener of choice<br />
A pinch of baking powder and baking soda<br />

Preheat oven to 350. Mix all ingredients together. Let sit for a minute or two for the coconut flour to absorb the liquid. Shape and flatten the cookies (they won’t rise). I used a small mason jar lid to make sure they were all the same size!  Bake 10-12 minutes.

**<u>Cream</u>**<br />
Coconut butter<br />
honey creme or honey to taste<br />
A bit of milk<br />

Mix all together. After the cookies have cooled a bit, put it all together and eat!

\*\*Note: After making these a few times, we have discovered that it is kind of a picky recipe. Make sure your eggs are on the smaller side. And we had better success with larger amounts of butter! Let us know how it went for you!
