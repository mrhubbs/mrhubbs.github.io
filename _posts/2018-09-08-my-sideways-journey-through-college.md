Last night we cleaned out the office. It hasn't been so empty since before we moved in &mdash; just about two years ago. It's amazing. It's a whole new room! I can't wait to start using it&hellip;

Anyway, there were lots of old items in there triggering lots of reminiscing in  my sentimental heart. Among the flotsam and jetsam were textbooks and notebooks from my college studies in 2015, 2016 and 2017. From those 3 years I have books and notebooks from 3 different colleges<!--more-->.

## Empathy

In high school I had mild scorn for people who got into college, didn't know what they wanted to do, transferred degrees &mdash; or schools &mdash; and, in my perception, wasted money. Life has a way of teaching you empathy, though, if you'll let it. And it'll also teach you, regardless of whether you let it or not, that life itself is *messy*. I was certain I wanted to go into engineering. And I was certain I wanted to study electrical engineering. My Dad and brother and grandfather and 3 or so uncles were electrical engineers and they loved what they did. The work sounded cool. What I didn't consider was that I'd never done the work. I hadn't even touched electronics, aside from some very easy-to-use toys. What I had been doing since I was 11 or 12 was programming. I'd even worked for 6 months as a software developer (summer between junior and senior years of high school and summer after graduating). Software, I would learn, was **very** different from electrical engineering and often very different from any sort of engineering. But electrical engineering sounded cool, and my Dad suggested studying it so I'd be more versatile, and I thought that it sounded like a good idea, and so off I went.

Somewhere at the end of freshman year or the beginning of sophomore year, I found that electrical engineering was hard. It didn't come to me like programming had, it involved a lot of math I didn't enjoy, and I wasn't super excited about it. I was excited by the things I could work on once I earned the degree, but I was't excited about the work it would take to get there. (That's a red flag for sure.) But I figured I didn't enjoy the work because it was really hard for me, that it was good to challenge myself, and that I'd like it eventually.

## Reasons I Left the First University

Fast-forward to junior year and I was already married. (The decision to marry in college had pretty much smashed my pre-conceptions of what I wanted and how I would go through college.) We were living about 20 &mdash; 25 minutes off-campus, Chloe was working full-time, I was working part-time remotely for the company I'd interned for the previous summer, and I was taking a full course-load. The school I was at was expensive, and I also wanted to graduate as soon as possible. I wanted to get out of the college bubble and work a professional job, with all the challenges that come with it, and bring in money so we could start a family. Hence arose my first motivation to push against the bubble. Chloe and I looked over the my degree plan. There were 1 &dash; 2 classes I could test out of due to my experience in software and it looked like I should be able to compress the schedule to graduate a semester earlier. So off I went to have multiple meetings with my academic advisor and, eventually, the dean of the college of electrical engineering.

My advisor was awesome and supportive and the dean was willing to listen. But it turned out to be a hassle. n the end, though, it wasn't a feasible plan. I'd have to take a class or two out-of-order. I wouldn't be taking the class before a prerequisite, just taking it before a class it was *typically* taken after. The dean was reluctant to approve because his program needed a rigorous adherence to the curriculum plan to stay in good standing with the accreditation organization.

(FACT CHECK, was that the case? Did we actually have a working plan that was halted by accreditation concerns?)

Around this time I began questioning my degree choice. As I'd progressed into the higher-level classes the coursework became really hard and I didn't like it. The complex math was interesting, but not interesting enough, to me, for me to enjoy it in a career. But I was taking a few computer science classes and really liking them. And I was still working the part-time job doing programming.

And so we thought "now what?" We kept praying about it and soon a question popped up in Chloe's mind: why can't you transfer to a cheaper school and take online classes / commute while working as an intern? She would have to quit her job but it wasn't working out for her anyway. Besides I could make at least as much interning as she was making at her salaried position. We would have to move, but we would be closer to her family, in a smaller town and we didn't like where we were anyway. The plan fit our life situation and seemed just out-there enough that it felt like the Holy Spirit's idea. So, having answered our failed attempt at an unconventional course plan with a more unconventional life plan, we set about transferring and moving.

## Reasons I Left the Second University

By the summer of 2015 I had begun working full-time at my internship position and transferred to a state school. I started some online gen-eds like an English class and economics. My first meeting with my advisor, at a satellite campus, had gone well and I was super pumped to save money and get a degree more inline with my interests. I went through my first semester that summer. Then in the fall I went through my second semester. Then the trouble started.

It was now time for me to start taking technical classes. I had known going in that I'd have to commute 50+ minutes to take the classes. But by this time we'd started settling into a peaceful, small-town, albeit-social-isolated life together. I did not want to make that commute for the next year. Plenty of people make that kind of drive, people who also have children and other responsibilities. But I think spending that much time in the car is a royal pain in the neck, inhuman and to be avoided if at all possible.

But that wasn't even the main problem. As I prepared to take classes I found out my advisor had never notified the main campus of my existence. They had not processed my transfer classes. I'd been taking classes for 6+ months but I wasn't officially a student! Thankfully I found a charitable advisor, named Mary, at the main campus who took on the, apparently significant, burden of processing 2 and 1/2 years of transfer credits. Lots of things carried over, my course path forward was clear, I identified some classes I should be able to get experience credit for, and then biggest problem came forward.

We had chosen that state school because it had a reputation for being more understanding and flexible for commuting and working students. And that is true. However, the classes I wanted to test out of were upper-level. The college had a strict policy that


## Why the 3rd University Worked Out

## What Benefits I got from Taking Time to Explore

I had certainly not waited to graduate college before starting the rest of life. While in school we had moved twice, bought a house, had a baby, founded an LLC (mostly on paper), and got a job.

## Did I Lose Money?

  - no, cheaper option

## Did It Hurt My Career?

  - no, because of the merit of my experience and ability to articulate and demonstrated abilities

## One of the Problems with Colleges

  - Started as liberal arts, general learning to understand the world
  - now career training, but more theoretical and missing practical experience
    - which is why people intern / co-op

## So What Should We Do?

  - Apprenticeships connected with theoretical learning?
  - Foster appreciation of higher learning (humanities)
  - Take time to smell the rose: converse and join in discourse
