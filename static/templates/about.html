Hi, I'm William (aka <a href='http://github.com/mrhubbs'>mrhubbs</a>).  Welcome to my website!
</p>
<p class='lead'>
This site contains documentation for personal code projects, my general software philosophy, a technical blog,
and the specific expertise I have to offer.
</p>

<h1 class='section-header'>Tech Bio</h1>
<p>
As a child, a strong interest in design led to hours reading about <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Swift#Second_series_.281954.E2.80.931971.29'>Tom Swift, Jr.'s inventions</a> and building with Legos.
Lego Mindstorms introduced me to programming.  Shortly thereafter I began learning C on Linux.
</p>
<p>
Ten years later, I am fluent in C and Python, familiar with a half-dozen other languages, and well-versed in web technologies.
