title = Salted Caramel Ice Cream
</metadata>

When experimenting with ice-cream one night, I accidentally discovered how to make a yummy salted caramel flavor.  The caramel flavor came from coconut sugar.  The salt came from salted butter I put in, in an attempt to make the ice-cream creamier.  It didn’t work, as the butter hardened into little clumps. But with the prevalence of the caramel flavor, the butter lumps tasted like caramel, not straight butter.

__Ingredients__

- 4 cups milk (containing as much cream as possible)
- 1 cup coconut sugar
- several tablespoons salted butter (if you don’t have salted butter, warm butter and mix salt in until the saltiness approximates that of salted butter)

__Directions__

- Melt butter on low heat.
- Whisk together milk and coconut sugar.
- Whisk in butter.
- Make in ice-cream maker as usual.

Enjoy!
