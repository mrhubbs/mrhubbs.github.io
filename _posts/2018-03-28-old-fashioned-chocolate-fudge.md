*Written January 27, 2017:* Adapted from: [old fashioned chocolate fudge](http://allrecipes.com/recipe/9420/old-fashioned-chocolate-fudge/)

**Ingredients**

  - 1/2 cup cacao
  - 1 cup milk<!--more-->
  - 4 tbsp butter
  - 1tsp vanilla
  - 2 cups (or less) sweetener

**Directions**

  - Combine sugar, cacao, and milk in a saucepan. Stir to blend, then bring to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce heat and simmer.  Do not stir again.
  - Cook until 238 degrees F. A drop of this mixture in cold water should form a ball and flatten between your fingers.
  - Remove from heat. Add butter and vanilla. Beat with a wooden spoon until it loses its sheen. It's worse to under-beat than to over-beat.
  - Pour into parchment-paper-lined pan, let it cool, and cut into squares
