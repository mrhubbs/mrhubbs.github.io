The other day I was really craving a protein smoothie, but upon looking in our freezer, found that I was out of the frozen bananas that I generally use as a smoothie base. Usually this would deter me, but I really was craving a smoothie. I decided to just throw some stuff together (completely omitting anything frozen which I would generally never do!) and hope for the best. What I got was way beyond expectation!! It was incredibly creamy, full of yummy peanut butter, and frankly, tasted like dessert. I was amazed and instantly began dreaming of all the different ways I could use this mousse in the future! I figured I had to share the recipe so you could all enjoy it yourselves. :)

Because I hadn’t been planning on sharing this recipe, I didn’t measure my ingredients, so some of the measurements may be slightly off and change the texture/taste of your mousse.

__5 Minute Peanut Butter Mousse__

Ingredients:

  - 1 ripe banana
  - 1/4 cup peanut butter
  - 1/4-1/3 cup full fat coconut milk
  - 1/2 tsp. vanilla
  - 2 Tbsp. hydrolyzed gelatin (for an extra protein boost!)
I didn’t add any extra sweetener, and thought it was quite sweet enough, but if you are looking for something extra sweet, you can add honey or maple syrup to taste.

Directions: Put all ingredients in a blender and pulse until well mixed
